*
* This program is centered around a Puzzle game that can be experienced either through 
* the console or with graphical elements. Users have the option to solve the puzzle
* interactively or let the program solve it automatically. If a user chooses to tackle
* the puzzle themselves, they can select a difficulty level that determines how many random 
* moves the '0' (or blank square) makes within the game board. Once the puzzle is shuffled, the 
* challenge begins as the user attempts to solve it by moving the '0' in various directionsâ€”up, 
* down, left, or right. Throughout the game, the program tracks the user's moves and displays them 
* at the end. Alternatively, for those who prefer an automated game, the user specifies the minimum 
* and maximum difficulty levels, the maximum number of moves, and the number of times each difficulty 
* level should be played. In this mode, the program undertakes the task of solving the puzzle randomly. 
* Upon completing the last difficulty level, it presents the user with their win percentage and the average 
* number of moves per game.
